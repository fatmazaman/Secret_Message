SECRET MESSAGE
================================================================================

My friends and I, we play a lot of pranks on each other. Today, however, I was on the receiving end of one. This morning, I could not find my house keys. Just then, I got a text message from a friend. We have hidden your house keys, said the text message. To find them, you have to solve a puzzle. On your computer there is a folder with several photos. If you rename all the files by removing the numbers from the photo name, the photos will reveal a secret message and
lead you to the house key.This renaming of 50 files will take a long time. I can't wait to solve this puzzle so I can get my friends back.

So, here I have a folder on my computer with a bunch of photos. Now, you'll notice that the message in these photos is all jumbled up, we can't quite read it just yet.Now, if I zoom into these photos, you'll notice that the names of the photos, they have numbers in them.

And it's our task to remove those numbers. And I wrote a program that does just
that. Let me run it. The output window shows all of the files that were renamed
and if I look at the folders again, you'll notice that the photos have been renamed.Their names don't have any numbers in them anymore.Also, if I zoom out just a little bit. You'll notice that the photos are now revealing a message. Which in this case is just, SOME SECRET MESSAGE. Let's build this program....
